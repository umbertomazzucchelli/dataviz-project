## Portfolio Title: "Climate in Crisis: Visualizing Our Changing Planet"

### Narrative Structure

I recommend organizing your portfolio as a journey that takes viewers through the evidence, impacts, and potential solutions to climate change:

1. **The Evidence** (Temperature Anomalies + Arctic Sea Ice)
2. **The Consequences** (Sea Level Rise + Extreme Weather + Migration) 
3. **The Accountability** (Carbon Budget + Carbon Footprints)

### Introduction Section

Start with a powerful, concise introduction that establishes:
- The urgency of climate change as a global challenge
- How data visualization can make complex climate science accessible
- Your goal of inspiring understanding and action through visual storytelling

### Portfolio Flow and Connections

**Section 1: The Evidence**

Begin with visualizations that establish the fundamental evidence of climate change:

*Global Temperature Anomalies Visualization*
- Opening visualization showing global temperature rise
- Transition text explaining how rising temperatures affect different Earth systems
- Visual connection to the Arctic visualization through highlighted regions

*Arctic Sea Ice Decline Visualization*
- Show dramatic ice loss as a visible symptom of warming
- Transition text connecting ice loss to consequences
- Visual elements that lead the eye toward the consequences section

**Section 2: The Consequences**

Build on the established evidence to show real-world impacts:

*Sea Level Rise Projections*
- Connect to ice melt from previous visualization
- Show coastal impacts on major cities
- Transition text linking to increased severe weather

*Extreme Weather Event Frequency*
- Visualization showing increasing pattern of events
- Include economic and human costs
- Transition text explaining how these disruptions force human migration

*Climate Migration Patterns*
- Show population movements driven by climate impacts
- Humanize the data with stories or representative scenarios
- Transition text about responsibility and solutions

**Section 3: The Accountability**

Conclude with visualizations that focus on responsibility and action:

*Carbon Budget Visualization*
- Show how emissions relate to observed and projected changes
- Include country-level responsibilities
- Transition text connecting to individual actions

*Carbon Footprint Comparisons*
- End with personal and institutional accountability
- Include hopeful elements showing impact of positive changes
- Conclude with call to action

### Interactive Elements That Connect Visualizations

To create cohesion across your portfolio:

1. **Consistent Color Scheme** - Use the same color palette across all visualizations to indicate similar elements (e.g., temperature ranges, risk levels)

2. **Linked Interactions** - Allow selections in one visualization to highlight related data in others

3. **Unified Time Controls** - Use synchronized time sliders that affect multiple visualizations simultaneously

4. **Persistent Navigation** - Create a navigation system that shows where each visualization fits in the overall story

5. **Visual Transitions** - Design smooth transitions between visualizations that maintain context

### Technical Implementation Approach

For Observable:
- Create a notebook collection organized by your narrative sections
- Use Observable's embed functionality to create a cohesive presentation
- Implement consistent styling across notebooks
- Create reusable D3 components that maintain visual consistency

Visualizations requirments:
In the age of data overload, visual storytelling stands out as a powerful means to communicate complex information simply, effectively, and beautifully. This project isn’t just about creating a visual representation of data; it's about crafting a narrative, evoking emotions, and inciting action.

Think of your favorite infographic or data visualization you've encountered. What made it memorable? Was it the stark revelation from the data, the creative design, or the emotions it evoked? Perhaps it was the curiosity it piqued or the pressing questions it answered. Now, envision your project doing just that.

Remember:

Evocative Visuals: The best visuals aren’t just accurate; they’re evocative. They should invoke curiosity and wonder, drawing viewers in, compelling them to explore, understand, and engage.

Narrative Flow: Every visualization tells a story. Consider the narrative arc – introduce the setting (context), present the challenges (data anomalies or trends), and lead towards a climax (major insight or discovery).

Innovation and Creativity: Often, the most striking visualizations challenge the norm. Think outside the box – consider innovative ways of representation, novel visualization techniques, or even marrying unrelated datasets for a fresh perspective.

Emotionally Resonant: Connect with your audience on an emotional level. Whether it's awe, concern, elation, or surprise, your visual should resonate emotionally. Data can often feel cold; it's the visualization that warms it up, giving it life and feeling.

Clarity in Complexity: Some of the best visuals simplify the most complex datasets. They strip away the noise, focusing on the essential, making intricate datasets accessible, understandable, and relatable.

Interactivity and Exploration: Think about how viewers will interact with your visualization. Can they delve deeper, explore different facets, or even challenge the insights? Engaging visuals often offer layers of depth, rewarding those who interact with richer insights.

Take this opportunity not just to showcase your technical prowess but also your ability to think deeply, empathize with your audience, and craft a compelling visual narrative. The beauty of data visualization lies in its unique intersection of art and science. So, as you embark on this project, approach it as a computer scientist, artist, storyteller and, most importantly, as a curious explorer looking to unearth and share the wonders hidden within the data.

A critical challenge will be scoping the assignment such that you can complete it within approximately 6 weeks. Focus on designing a limited yet compelling visualization that reveals important insights along a few critical dimensions and then layer on additional complexity. A tightly focused, well-implemented visualization is much preferred to a sprawling design that attempts too much!

Design a portfolio-level graphic (with any necessary visualization techniques) to explore or understand a compelling question for a dataset of your own choosing. To determine what subset of the data and which visualizations are promising, we encourage you to perform additional exploratory analysis. What aspects of the data reveal the most interesting discoveries or stories? Do not feel obligated to try to convey everything about the data: focus on a compelling subset.
